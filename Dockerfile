#Well well well... it seems like we have some documentation here!
#Steps to follow:
# 1) Start MongoDB docker container like such: docker run -p 172.17.0.1:27017:27017 --name some-mongo --restart unless-stopped -d mongo --auth
# 2) Type "docker exec -it some-mongo mongo admin" and then create an Admin user with a password and stuff like suggested in this post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29472184
# 3) Create a logger container like indicated here: docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 --link some-mongo --name=logger --restart unless-stopped -e DATABASE='mongodb://user:password@some-mongo:27017' -d assaservice/logger-user
# 4) Enjoy loggin awesome stuff. It's really important to do it, otherwise you need to start again the previous commands, which may lead to a long iteration until the enjoyment happens. Please contact your shrink if it does not happen shortly.
